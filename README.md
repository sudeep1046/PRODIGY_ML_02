# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains code for performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`. The dataset includes the following features:

- `CustomerID`: Unique ID for each customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned to the customer (1-100).

## Installation

To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Ensure Mall_Customers.csv is in the same directory as the code.
Run the script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, apply K-Means clustering, and visualize the results.
