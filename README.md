## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about mall customers, including:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named `Mall_Customers.csv`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using pandas.

### Feature Selection
The features used for clustering are:
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

### Data Preprocessing
The data is scaled using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

### Clustering
The K-Means algorithm is used to segment customers into 5 clusters.

### Running the Code
Execute the code to perform clustering and visualize the results:

```python
python cluster.py
```

## Model Evaluation
The clustering labels are assigned to the dataset, and the results are visualized using a scatter plot.

## Visualization
A scatter plot is created to visualize the customer clusters and centroids.
